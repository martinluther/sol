Introduction
==========
This is a Plone theme for Martin Luther College's website. It is based on Plone 4.x.

General Ideas
==========
The goal is to create a clean, flexible, template-based theme while still keeping the "Ploney bits" intact to allow content management to take place without me pulling my hair out. Some of the more specific goals include (but are not limited to):

* incorporate new logo
* simplify primary navigation
* provide more/better/larger pictures
* logical structure for the site
* use of school's new colors
* prominance of mission
* providing mobile users with the information they NEED

Like I said, not all of them are listed, but those are a few.

Programming Method
==========
This is my first foray into Plone development on the filesystem, so bear with me if things are looking ugly and cluttered.

Toolsets/Libraries
==========
Here are some of the tools being used:

* JQuery
* Typekit
* HTML
* CSS
* Common Sense?

I tossed that last one in there for fun. No funny business, just staying as far away from Flash as possible. It will be used strictly as a steaming medium for the video productions (outside of my jurisdiction).
